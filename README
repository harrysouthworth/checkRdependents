Python module for testing an R package prior to submission to CRAN.

The module lets you specify a package name (e.g. 'gbm') and it then obtains
names of dependent packages from CRAN, downloads the latest package sources into
a directory (defaults to "tarballs"), and runs R CMD check on all of them.

This workflow assumes that you've installed the R CMD checked the package you're
considering for CRAN submission. As yet, it does not attempt to install any
further dependencies of the downloaded packages.
